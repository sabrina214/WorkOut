A Gray code is a list of all 2^n bit strings of length n, where any two successive strings differ in exactly one bit (i.e., their Hamming distance is one).

Your task is to create a Gray code for a given length n.

Input

The only input line has an integer n.

Output

Print 2n lines that describe the Gray code. You can print any valid solution.

Constraints
1≤n≤16
Example

Input:
2
